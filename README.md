In this Project we tried to work with one of the best library of python turtle, it is absolutely useful when working with graphs or trees. It will let you draw, set nodes and edges very ez and simple.

The actual Project is for the my friend Bardia which has to be done and presented at University Geothe of Frankfurt, but i asked him to let me publish this wonderful project on my github. 

Project has four files, main, Kanten(edges), Knoten(nodes) and DFS file. I have written some comments to clarify what the functions are doing but as a matter of fact the whole project is not too complicated. 

The main proess is that user has 3 options at first : 

- Tell the program how many nodes he or she wants to set
Then the program will set the nodes alphabetically circular.

- Tell the program what names he/she wnats to set
Then the program will see how many names there are and tries to set the nodes 

- Or tell the program exactly where the nodes are going to be 


Finally user must define the edges and connections between nodes which is the core of DFS then what will be happening is that the DFS file starts to check whether the connections make this Graph a Tree or not.




Thanks for your time and i recommend you guys to see what turtle actually does ...
